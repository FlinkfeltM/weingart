        <h2 id="the-man"> <strong>Early life and Education.</strong></h2>
   <div class="text">
    
    <p>Weingart was born February 1941, near the Swiss border in southern Germany, Salem Valley. He grew up during the end of the second world war. According to Weingart himself, his childhood was the most important part of his life, even though it was at the end of a prolonged war, it was at this time that he realized that he was more of a doer than a thinker.</p>
    <p>Weingart was never fond of the typical education given to him; the idea of cramming information into his head didn’t appeal to him. With various creative methods, he cheated his ways throughout school, from drilling holes into his desk, reading the answers to making a battery driven device to tell him the anticipated answers written and placed into the same device the night before.</p>

    <p> At the age of 13, in 1954 he moved to Lisbon with his mother for a brief period of time, only to return to Germany four years later in 1958. After his return to Germany he enrolled in Merz Academy in Stuttgart, where he attended a two-year programme in graphic arts. During these two years at Merz Academy he developed certain skills including typesetting, linocut and woodblock printing.</p>
       
    <p>After his time at Merx Academy, Weingart began his typesetting apprenticeship in hot metal hand composition at Ruwe Printing, where he came into contact with the designer Karl-August Hanke, who was the consulting designer of the company. Hanke became Weingart’s mentor, encouraging him to continue his studies in Switzerland.</p>
       
    <p>At the beginning of his three year typesetting apprenticeship, Weingart became fascinated with Swiss typography and graphic design. In 1963, he arranged a visit to Basel, to meet with Armin Hofmann with hopes of getting accepted into the Basel School of Design. In a turn of events, during the interview when Weingart was showing Hofmann his works, he was asked if he would consider teaching in his Graphics design programme. A year later Weingart moved to Basel and enrolled in the school as an independent student. In 1968 he got hired to teach typography in the advanced class for graphic design at the Basel School of Design.</p>

    <section><h2 id="the-typeface"> <strong>The typeface</strong> </h2>
    <div class="text"><p>Baskerville is a Transitional serif typeface designed by John Baskerville in 1757, positioned between the Old Style typefaces of William Caslon, and the modern styles of Giambattista Bodoni and Firmin Didot. </p>
   <p>The typeface is the result of Baskerville's intent to improve upon the types of William Caslon. He increased the contrast between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis of rounded letters to a more vertical position. The curved strokes are more circular in shape, and the characters became more regular. These changes created a greater consistency in size and form.</p>
    <p>Baskerville's work was criticised by jealous competitors and soon fell out of favour. Since the 1920s, however, numerous revivals of Baskerville have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries. Émigré released a popular revival of the typeface in 1996 called Mrs Eaves, named for Baskerville's wife, Sarah Eaves. Baskerville represents the peak of Transitional type face design and bridges the gap between Old Style and Modern type design.</p>

    <section><h2 id="mrs-eaves"> <strong> Mrs Eaves</strong></h2>
    <div class="text"><p> Eaves is named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville's wife. As Baskerville was setting up his printing and type business, Mrs. Eaves moved in with him as a live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his wife after the death of her first husband, Mr. Eaves.
   Mrs Eaves is a revival of the types of English printer and punch-cutter John Baskerville, and is related to contemporary Baskerville typefaces.</p>
    <p>Like Baskerville, Mrs Eaves, cut by Zuzana Licko of Émigré, has a near vertical stress, departing from the Old Style model. Identifying characters, similar to Baskerville's types, are the lowercase g with its open lower counter and swash-like ear. Both the roman and italic uppercase Q have a flowing swash-like tail. The uppercase C has serifs at top and bottom; there is no serif at the apex of the central junction in uppercase W; and the uppercase G has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial serif.</p>
