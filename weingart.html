        <h2> <strong>Prologue.</strong></h2>
        
   <div class="text">
    
    <p>Weingart was born February 1941, near the Swiss border in southern Germany, Salem Valley. He grew up during the end of the second world war. According to Weingart himself, his childhood was the most important part of his life, even though it was at the end of a prolonged war, it was at this time that he realized that he was more of a doer than a thinker.</p>
    <p>Weingart was never fond of the typical education given to him; the idea of cramming information into his head didn’t appeal to him. With various creative methods, he cheated his ways throughout school, from drilling holes into his desk, reading the answers to making a battery driven device to tell him the anticipated answers written and placed into the same device the night before.</p>

    <p> At the age of 13, in 1954 he moved to Lisbon with his mother for a brief period of time, only to return to Germany four years later in 1958. After his return to Germany he enrolled in Merz Academy in Stuttgart, where he attended a two-year programme in graphic arts. During these two years at Merz Academy he developed certain skills including typesetting, linocut and woodblock printing.</p>
       
    <p>After his time at Merx Academy, Weingart began his typesetting apprenticeship in hot metal hand composition at Ruwe Printing, where he came into contact with the designer Karl-August Hanke, who was the consulting designer of the company. Hanke became Weingart’s mentor, encouraging him to continue his studies in Switzerland.</p>
       
    <p>At the beginning of his three year typesetting apprenticeship, Weingart became fascinated with Swiss typography and graphic design. In 1963, he arranged a visit to Basel, to meet with Armin Hofmann with hopes of getting accepted into the Basel School of Design. In a turn of events, during the interview when Weingart was showing Hofmann his works, he was asked if he would consider teaching in his Graphics design programme. A year later Weingart moved to Basel and enrolled in the school as an independent student. In 1968 he got hired to teach typography in the advanced class for graphic design at the Basel School of Design.</p>

    <section><h2> <strong>Where does it come from?</strong> </h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

           <p> The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

    <section><h2> <strong> Why do we use it?</strong></h2>
    <div class="text"><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
